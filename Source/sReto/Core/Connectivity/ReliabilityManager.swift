* The ReliablityManager is responsible for cleanly closing connections and attempting to reconnect failed connections.

* TODO: This class currently assumes that if connecting takes longer than a specific amount of time (1 second), the connection attempt failed and tries to reconnect. This causes issues if establishing the connection takes longer than 1 second, especially with routed/multicast connections, causing the connection establishment process to fail. To fix this, the next attempt should only be started after a generous timeout or if the connection establishment process failed, and not if it is still in progress.
