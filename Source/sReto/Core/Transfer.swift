/**
* A Transfer object represents a data transfer between two or more peers. 
* It has two subclasses, InTransfer and OutTransfer, which represent an incoming transfer (i.e. a data transfer that is being received) and an outgoing transfer (i.e. a data transfer that is being sent to some other peer).
* OutTransfers are created by calling one of the send methods on the Connection class.
* InTransfers are created by the Connection class when the connected peer starts a data transfer. At this point, the connection's onTransfer event is invoked. Thus, InTransfers can be obtained by using the onTransfer event exposed by the Connection class.
